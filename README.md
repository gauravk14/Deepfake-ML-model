Deepfake Detection Using CNN

A lightweight and educational Deepfake Detection system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras.
This project classifies images as Real or Fake using supervised learning on face datasets.

Overview

This project implements a simple but effective binary image classifier to detect manipulated (deepfake) images.
It contains:    

A complete training pipeline
A prediction script for inference
Fully working CNN model
Dataset loading + preprocessing
Model saving (.keras) and evaluation
The project is intended for students, researchers, and cybersecurity learners who want to understand the basics of deepfake detection.
